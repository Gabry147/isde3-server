# Second Assignment Delivery
#### Gabriele Scarton
This is the third assignment for [IntroSDE course] at [Unitn].
The goal of the assignment is to create a SOAP service composed by a server and a test client.
The server is deployed on Heroku at **isde3-scarton.herokuapp.com**
This repository contains the server.
## Specifications
  - Dependency manager: [Ivy]
  - Build tool: [Ant]
  - Database: [SQLite]
  - Persistency unit: [EclipseLink]

##  The repository
The server contains its _build.xml_ file, the _ivy.xml_ dependencies file and the source code.
The src folder contains three packages:
  - **model** contains the entities.
  - **DAO** contains the class with all the methods for accessing the persistence data. 
  - **endpoint** contains the publisher needed in order to run the server
  - **soap** contains the SOAP interface and its implementation, which is only a mapping to the DAO's functions

## How to run the code
The server is deployed on heroku using the heroku buildpack available at https://github.com/IntroSDE/heroku-buildpack-ant.git
The server can also be packed into a .WAR file, automatically generated by [Ant] with the console command:
``` 
$ ant create.war 
```

At the first run, the server creates an empty _isde3.sqlite_ database, which is cleared at every re-deploy.
